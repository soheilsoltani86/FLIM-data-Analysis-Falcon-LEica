%%  Analysis Template for FLIM data analysis
%  Update: 08/24/2021
%  Peiyu Wang

%  This is a template matlab program for data analysis.
%  Expected Data input: Exported GS files with Fast FLIM from Leica Falcon
%  System.
%  This program analyzes multiple layers; 

% Please do not put anything that is not the exported data in any
% subfolders.

%  This dataset had 2 fluorescence detector channels, which generate 8 output channels:
%  First detector: SYTO59 staining dye.
%  Second detector: NADH autofluroesence.

%  The input also stored the Bright Field data in the BF file


%  Workflow anlaysis:
%  Data input ->  Mask Generation -> Thresholding -> Filtering ->
%  Metablic analysis based on masking -> data output.

%  You can comment out entires sections if there are workflow precedures that you do not want.

%  Prerequisite: Function folder from the TIC collaborator github repository

close all; clear all;

addpath("Functions"); %Change the path name to the location of "Function",
%or put "Function" folder on the folder as the matlab
%script.
%% Input Variables

NADH_dec = 1;         % The detector sequence (not the channel) for NADH.
% NADH_dec depends on how many detector are activated before NADH is colected.
% If one other detector was activated, and NADH was second detector, put 2.
% Usually input as 1. For default dataset in script, as we have another dye collected beore NADH, therefore set as 2.

imageSize = img_size;                        % Image Input Size

Excel_file = 'Analysis.xlsx';   % Name of the excel file to store all the data. Do not omit the ".xlsx"
%% Analysis procedures setup:
% For all the procedures, if you want to include, assign varable as 1, if asign as 0.
%% Masking Analysis
% If you wish to do analysis based on generated masks, asign mask_analyzing
% as 1, otherwise asign as 0. 
% Expect mask to be in the "mask" folder in the folder of the dataset, as
% mask_img.tif or mask_img_z0.tif for z stack analysis. 

% Mask creation settings is included in the next procedures.  

mask_analyzing = 0;      %If you wish to do analysis based on generated masks, asign mask_analyzing as 1, otherwise asign as 0. 

%% Mask creation procedure.
% Masking based on another input image for the same field of view
% Only do it if you have another image collected to generate the mask.
% If not, select 0 for all settings. Only one of the three procedures recomended here. Set zeros for others. .
batch_threshold_mask = 1;       % Batch thresholding for creating masks
individual_threshold_mask = 0;  % individual thresholding for masks
individual_draw_mask = 0;       % individual thresholding for masks.


%Additional Settings:
mask_ch = 1;                 % mask_ch: The channel which is used the generate the mask
% notice please input as the matlab order, "ch0.tif" will be input as 1.
mask_thresh = 500;            % Set to your batch masking value if batch_threshold_mask is select. Otherwise set as 0.
%%  Filtering proceure.
%  If you want to include the filtering, assign varable as 1, if not asign as 0.
%  Recommend to only include one, although if you want you can do both.
%  Recommend wavelet filtering when exporting the dataset.

cnlm_filtering =  0;        % Correlated Non local Mean filetering: Warning: might take quite some time.
med_filtering  =  1;         % Median fileting.


%  Advanced settings:  Refer to functions scripts. Changing is not necessary
window_size  =  3;            % Windowsize for median fileter and CNLM
serch_size   =  9;            % Search size for CNLM
average_coe  =  35;           % Averaging coefficient for CNLM.

%%  Thresholding for NADH based on NADH intensity Images
%   Leica output files does not output NADH thresholding.
%   Therefore thresholding is recomended for NADH Analysis.
%

NADH_thresholding  =  1;              % If you want to include the thresholding, assign varable as 1, if asign as 0

% Additional settings:
NADH_thresh_val  =  30;                % Threshold value for NADH in phasor analysis.
% Recommended value: At least 7 to get accurate counts.
% Recommend to decide value during you image acquition and when previewing  your images.

%% Caluculate phaosr representative for phasor cluster
%  Different ways to calculate the phasor representatives.
%  One, and only one should be assigned as 1. 

phasor_mode_calculating  =  1; % To calculate phasor based on mode, assign varable as 1, if not asign as 0

phasor_cen_calculating  =  0;  % To caluclaed phasor based on centroid, assign varable as 1, if not asign as 0

% phasor_mode_calculating is recommended, as it filter out noise components from other molecular speices that don't donminate the field of view.

%% Advanced Data Settings: Z analysis
% For Analysis of 3D stack layers. Number os z layers is calcualted  based on the total number of inputs channels inside the folder,
% and the total number of detectors that are used. Expecting 4 channel output for all detectors.
% Z stacks do not need to be the same for all data sets.
% If z_analysis is set to 0, it only takes the first z layer. 

z_analysis = 1;       %If you want to analyze based on different z, assign varable as 1, if not asign as 0

total_detector = 1;   % Enter the number of detector used for the imaging setting.

% Please mannually check whether the total number of tiff files in folder is : 4 *number of detectors * number of z stacks.

%% Advanced Data Settings: Output summary image of the condition. 

phasor_image = 1;             % Plot individual image for phasor plot before summarizing.
phasor_original_image = 1;    % plot original phasor image bofore filtering and preprocessing the image. 
summary_image = 1;            % plot summary image with phasor plot and intensity information. 
 
store_image = 1;              % Store the image inside the "Figures" folder. created.   
image_folder = "SavedFigures";     % Name of the figures folder.  All images will be stored in the figure folder. 

close_image = 1;                % closing all images after each field of view: Highly recommended if you have many datasets. This let you store the sumary image above.

%% Advanced Analysis for NADH metabolism analysis
% Plese refer to the function discription for detailed analysis. 

% lineExtensionMetabolism: Draw line from free NADH, connect the input and
% intersect with output. 
% Output: 
% Free_LEXT:  The Free NADH proportion of the clusters based on LEXT
% G_int: The G cordinate for the Bound NADH. 
% S_int: The S cordinate for the Bound NADH. 
% tao: The lifetime for the Bound NADH. 

% LinearRegression_Analysis: Do linear regression for all datapoint, with
% free NADH point guaruenteed. 
% Output: 
% Free_LEXT:  The Free NADH proportion of the clusters based on LEXT
% G_int: The G cordinate for the Bound NADH. 
% S_int: The S cordinate for the Bound NADH. 
% tao: The lifetime for the Bound NADH. 

%% HT: use G_sum instead of G_averages to match the dimensions of S_sum. Otherwise, it throws errors
[Free_LEXT,G_int,S_int,tao] = lineExtensionMetabolism(G_sum, S_sum);
%   This is for the Line Extension metabolism analyis.
Free_LR = LinearRegression_Analysis(G_sum, S_sum);
%   This is for the Linear Regression analysis.
